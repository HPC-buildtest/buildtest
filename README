The Application Testing repository consist of test cases designed to test the software packages after installation.

In order to write your test cases, please use the testgen.sh script to generate your template test script. Afterward make any changes necessary to test script along with adding your own source code necessary to test the application.

The testgen.sh script is designed to test binaries, for instance if you want to write a test case to test a specific binary this can be done very quickly. The script testgen.sh will use the template file template.txt in order to write the test case. 

Please refer to help command in order to learn how to use the testgen.sh. Simply type testgen.sh --help 

Each test case will reside in a directory <software>/<version> where software and version are specified in the testgen.sh script. The software and version must match the name of the module you are trying to test because it will use this for loading the appropriate module and put that in the test case. 

The command used to generate the  test case will be recorded in a file <software>/<version>/input.txt
Likewise, a file <software>/<version>/testall.sh will contain a list of test cases to run. This is only useful to run test cases in batch.
