buildtest
---------

buildtest is a software stack testing framework that automates test creation and execution to help HPC facilities to
better support and validate their software stack. buildtest is a central repository with collection of tests for all
scientific software that is installed in HPC. buildtest makes use of `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ configuration to write
test configuration that is reusable and adaptable to other HPC sites.

To get started with buildtest see `Setup Section <https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>`_


buildtest-configs
----------------------

**buildtest-configs** is composed of YAML configuration and source code for test scripts that will be compiled by
buildtest. This repository is a test toolkit to conduct software testing at your HPC facility.
