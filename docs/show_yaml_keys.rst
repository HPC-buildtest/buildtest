--------------------------------------------

buildtest comes with an option ``--show-keys`` that provides a description of all
yaml keys support by buildtest when writing yaml configuration.

.. code::

    [siddis14@prometheus buildtest-framework]$ _buildtest --show-keys
                     Key              Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                binaries              list of binary command to execute in command.yaml
                buildcmd              A list of commands to be executed for building the program. Must include runcmd key for running the code. If test doesnt
    require anything to run, then declare runcmd with no value
               buildopts              build options passed to build command...
                    cuda              enable cuda. Sets the compiler wrapper to nvcc. (Not implemented).    value: [enabled]
                 envvars              A list to declare environment variables inside the test script
               inputfile              inputfile is used to change stdin to a file that is passed to executable
                    iter              Create N tests scripts from a particular YAML file
                jobslots              Specify total job slots to use in jobscript
                     mpi              enable mpi wrapper. Sets the compiler wrapper accordingly. value: [enabled]
                    name              Name of the test script to be generated by buildtest. It must match the name of the yaml file.
                   nproc              Argument to -np to indicate number of processes to use with mpirun
              outputfile              outputfile is used to change stdout to a file
               procrange              Specify range for MPI process (argument to -np) for buildtest to create a parameterized set of test scripts. Format:
    <start>,<end>, <interval>
                  runcmd              A list of commands to be executed in order after the buildcmd. The buildcmd must be specified, if nothing to build set
    buildcmd key no value. Use this key to run the program
             runextracmd              Add extra commands after running code, only used when buildcmd and runcmd are not specified and additional instructions
    need to be specified
               scheduler              Specify type of resource scheduler to create job script automatically. Valid options : [ LSF, SLURM ]
                  source              Name of the source file to compile or run.
             threadrange              Specify range for OpenMP thread for buildtest to create a parameterized set of test scripts. Format:
    <start>,<end>,<interval>
